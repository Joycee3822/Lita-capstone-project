# ðŸ“Š Capstone Sales Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the sales performance of a retail store, aiming to reveal valuable insights and trends. By examining the sales data, we look into top-selling products, regional sales performance, and monthly sales patterns. The end result is an interactive Power BI dashboard that highlights these findings for better decision-making.

## Objectives
- Analyze sales performance across products, regions, and time periods.
- Extract insights on sales patterns, top-performing items, and customer purchasing behavior.
- Develop an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize and explore these insights.

## Data Analysis Steps

### 1. Excel Analysis
- **Data Exploration:** Begin by exploring the data in Excel.
  - **Pivot Tables:** Summarize total sales by product, region, and month.
  - **Formulas:** Calculate important metrics such as:
    - Average sales per product
    - Total revenue by region
- **Additional Reports:** Create supplementary reports or charts to highlight trends or outliers.

### 2. SQL Analysis
Load the dataset into your SQL Server environment for detailed data querying:
- **Total Sales by Category:** Calculate total sales for each product category.
- **Regional Sales Transactions:** Count sales transactions by region.
- **Top-Selling Product:** Identify the product with the highest total sales.
- **Revenue by Product:** Calculate the revenue generated by each product.
- **Monthly Sales Totals:** Determine monthly sales totals for the current year.
- **Top Customers:** Identify the top 5 customers by total purchase amount.
- **Regional Contribution:** Calculate each regionâ€™s contribution to total sales as a percentage.
- **Products with No Sales:** Identify products with no sales in the last quarter.

### 3. Power BI Dashboard
Create an interactive Power BI dashboard with the following features:
- **Sales Overview:** A summary of overall sales performance.
- **Top-Performing Products:** Visualizations of the highest-selling products.
- **Regional Breakdown:** Charts showing sales distribution across regions.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Excel:** Initial data exploration and summary reporting.
- **SQL (SQL Server):** Data querying for deeper insights.
- **Power BI:** Building an interactive dashboard for visual analysis.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/Joycee3822/Lita-Capstone-project`
2. **Dataset Preparation:** Load the dataset into your SQL Server for analysis.
3. **Excel Analysis:** Follow Excel steps for initial data exploration.
4. ## Data Source
The dataset for this project was provided as part of a class assignment and contains simulated retail sales data for analysis purposes.
________
## Dataset
- The dataset used for this project contains the following fields:
- OrderID: Unique identifier for each order
- CustomerID: Identifier for each customer
- Product: Name of the product sold
- Region: Geographical region where the sale occurred
- OrderDate: Date the order was placed
- Quantity: Number of units sold
- UnitPrice: Price per unit of the product
- Revenue: Total revenue from each order (calculated as Quantity * UnitPrice)
- #### Remove Duplicates:
Highlighted all data (Ctrl + A) and removed duplicates via Data tab > Remove Duplicates option. This step removed 40,079 duplicate values, leaving 9,921 unique records. 

#### Reason:
Removing duplicates ensures data accuracy by eliminating repeated entries that could skew sales insights and lead to incorrect analysis.

#### Calculate Revenue:
Added a new column to calculate revenue using the formula Quantity * Unit Price for each order. 

#### Reason:
Calculating revenue allows us to analyze total earnings per product, region, and period, which is essential for evaluating sales performance and profitability.
5. **SQL Queries:** Use SQL scripts to retrieve insights.
6. **Power BI Dashboard:** Use Power BI to visualize results and create the dashboard.
